# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

NetApp - Network Appliance
## 
## What is the problem?

Can NetApp use cheaper SSDs?

## Why is the problem importnat?


## What dataset has been made available?


## What specific questions are being raised?


# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

Understand what's going on with the times

## (My team's question)
What do the first two time columns measure?
## (My team's question)
Why not use technology based on customer usage?
## (My team's question)
Are those times actual timestamps?

That means it talked to Controller A or B 

Distribution of measure times. Serial number vs delta. 

# Approach

Based on the information you've obtained during the Q/A session, come up with
plan how your team will tackle this problem.

## How should the dataset be imported into Tableau?


## How should the work be distributed among the team members?


## What types of charts or visualizations to use to support the answer?


## What questions may be too complex for Tableau and may require custom scripts to be written?
